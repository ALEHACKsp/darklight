Darklight was a CS:GO Pay to cheat centered around movement. 

In it's inital phases it had done well in growth and development, however around the beggening of December, the /install directory was left open and the SQL database was deleted. This lead the developer, whatinthehells and seraphim to leave the project.

I had hired a new developer, BugNerd, after had shown me some past work and after a promising start it was going well.
After several days- unexpectedly he leaked the source and left.
